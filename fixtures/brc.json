IF THY DOES NOT COVET THY TITTY, they will come\n2\nby 2,&quot; said the voice. \nSince 1999 I have gone to the Black Rock Desert with my dedicated tribe, because\nit takes a few dedicated people to build a City of Tittys. I have collected Titty\nprints using a special painting technique. I start first by preparing my painting\nsurfaces by sanding and sealing 4 foot by eight foot pieces of plywood. I then\npaint the surfaces and frame them. These are my building blocks. I apply paint\nto the tittys and press them onto the boards transferring the prints onto them\neach titty soul then signs the prints, immortalizing them forever. I build my\nbuildings in increments of 8 feet. Each building is 16 feet by 16 feet. Each\npanel locks the other panels into a rigid structure, able to withstand 70 m.p.h.\nwind gusts. And at night they glow under 12, 48 inch double tube black lights.\nIts a process of evolution, it keeps growing and changing.",

Has the dust finally settled, leaving us with an alphabet destined to remain eternally 'as is'? Perhaps a closer look at each letter will let us trace back to the original impulses that began their descent first into images, then later into signs. We also look at how lines in the Chinese ideograms retain elements of the experience of hope and fear. Drawing on the ephemeral material of sand, we invite all signs and symbols of the ancient past and distant future to converge right here, right now in our infinite bodies, the eternal crossroads where hope and fear are forever getting down.",

Humanity (represented by the trunk) unites the earth (represented by the roots) to the spirit world (represented by the branches reaching towards the heavens). The Tree of Life speaks of our need to honor spirit as we play here on earth, and through this we find balance. This installation is my response to the apocalyptic energy that has penetrated our entire culture; my belief is that the current paradigm must shift, quickly and dramatically, in order for the planet to survive. The Burning Tree communicates that this shift must occur on an individual basis. It expresses the role of each human as the unifying force between heaven and earth. Only through this magnitude of transformation can the future exist.",

The action of brc.ing will be initiated by the dancers each sundown, and participants will join in weaving the inner space. A minimal ambient hypnotic sound-design will accompany their thoughts as they weave their own paths through the space between the hands and inspire people to gradually start to dance in relation to the mesh. The more people weave, the denser the brc.will become. Thus each participant has to face the actions and paths of previous players. The white yarn will be illuminated with black light, bringing the brc.to a glow.

In their era, the great Gothic cathedrals were ultimate symbols of hope and fear in the future &#151; the hope of a New Jerusalem that awaited the faithful, and the fear of eternal punishment and Armageddon. In the history of our western culture, the cathedral remains as a timeless embodiment of place for spiritual gathering and primary religious experiences. Our vision of Cathedral, as well as for faith and worship in the future, retains the qualities of communion with the divine, but we envision it also as a place for any to worship as they please, side by side in harmony, mutual respect and tolerance, without dogmatic conflict or even need for dogma. Our Cathedral is the physical expression of this hope, and an opportunity for a living practice of these beliefs. The Cathedral aspires to inspire all BRC residents to participate and interact with it; to generate ritual, ceremony, and art; to dance, celebrate, and surrender; to experience joy, communion, and spirit; to play together in laughter, fun, and silliness.",

The counterpoint to this past aesthetic is the television at the base of each structure which serves as a symbol of a range of time in modernity. Above each television hangs a large, heavy, dangerous, industrial object. The precarious positions of the objects above the televisions serve as a metaphor for modern humanity&rsquo;s propensity for being its own worst enemy. The video images on each of the televisions are of the four Aristotelean elements; earth, air, water and fire and were shot on the Black Rock Desert during different seasons of the year.",

While there, travelers contemplated the end of the known world and then burned their pilgrimage clothes in order to begin a new journey homeward. The installation site and performance (which will occur near sundown on Thursday and Friday) offer burners an opportunity to reflect on ideas of death, rebirth, the end of time, the end of the known and the beginning of the unknown, and if they choose, transmute paper messages with hopes, fears, and dreams into fire by placing them in an altar-like burn barrel.",

The speed of the disc's rotation and the changing angle of sunlight produce daily additions to an evolving solar artwork, which includes painted calligraphies addressing the ideas of hopes and fears, collected from our community. At night, strobes, mirrors and other lighting entice citizens to spin the disc, randomly illuminating the contributed words invoking hope and fear.",

Mandala, which means \"container of essence\" in Sanskrit, has long symbolized both a microcosm of the universe from the human perspective as well as spiritual centers of meditation. In contrast to the 2-dimensional mandalas of Hindu and Buddhist religions, however, this mandala has been translated into 3-dimensions. Seen from above, the eight columns are arranged in a circular pattern on the ground, symbolizing an 8-spoked \"wheel of life\" as it is known in Buddhism. Midway up the structure, the horizontally extending bamboo arms transform this wheel into an (8/3) star polygon... a geometric pattern found frequently in Islamic art. Further up, a shift in the arrangement of horizontal bamboo poles creates an (8/2) star polygon,\nalso known as the Star of Lakshmi. The structure terminates at an invisible point 55 feet up from ground level, at the vertex of a star point as seen from ground level. The structure\u00b4s principal dimensions of 55' high x 55' wide essentially enclose it in a giant invisible cube... and the star polyhedra\u00b4s center at the 27.5 foot midpoint define a giant sphere within that cube. Furthermore, a Fibonacci sequence of numbers, found in nature\u00b4s countless geometric patterns, is also found within the structure. The building material, bamboo, is strong, light, and incredibly flexible; multifunctional and highly renewable to the point of being indispensable in cultures ranging from Latin America to Asia; and it exudes a curious mixture of humble abandon and dignified poise.",

The arch explodes outward, creating a gallant entrance to Center Camp and in fact creating a whole environment. Every participant on a bicycle becomes part of the sculpture. Building the arch with bikes reclaimed from garbage dumps and recycling centers fits perfectly with the 2007 green theme. Bike Rack was inspired by the artist's trip to Arches National monument. An arch is symbolic of many powerful things, like victory and balance, and appears throughout history. Its context and meaning is open to interpretation; for this artist, making sculpture is striving for a sense of victory personally and collectively.",

The focal point is a 16 foot tower, positioned due east from the Man, from which is broadcast the Call to Prayer via solar powered megaphones and sound system. At the base an interior prayer/chill space is outfitted with prayer rugs and pillows. The project does not presume an intimate knowledge of Islam and recognizes that while all structured religions have their issues and faults, the original focus of Islam and other religions, is to connect man with their spirituality and God. In today&rsquo;s political context it may be valuable to help demystify the &ldquo;other&rdquo;, and we hope this project encourages dialog about spirituality, organized religion, and Islam.",

The inner cone is a fixed structure that supports and holds the outer cone, which is rotatable, attached to the inner one. Both consist of a bearing structure made of spirally fixed timber slats. The construction method is according to the principals of the Russian engineer Suchow: to create the layers as thin as possible and to avoid huge beams in the structure. The surfaces of the two bodies have a virtually homogenous fa\u00e7ade, which appears as one simple body. People and wind will keep the outer Cone in rotation while several dynamos on the inside are generating electricity. Depending on how much energy can be produced the dynamos will power a light beam and several other light effects. Thus people can immediately enjoy the self-produced energy inside and outside the construction.",

The electric car, once the \"zero-emissions\" darling of environmentalists, is sometimes maligned as an \"emissions-elsewhere\" vehicle, since the electricity to charge its batteries must be generated in electrical generation plants that produce emissions. This is a reasonable point, but we must then ask how much pollution an electric car produces per mile - accounting for all emissions, starting from the gas or oil well where the source fuel is extracted, all the way to the final consumption of electricity by the car's motor. When we work through the numbers, we find that the electric car is significantly more efficient and pollutes less than all alternatives",

A green power station is located fifty feet from the center of the piece. On top of the power station are two sets of solar arrays (to power the lighting and supplement orbiting motions) providing deep shade for a stationary, two-seated bicycle. One or two participants can power the the speed of the orbits while continuously charging batteries for night time lighting.",

The Giving Tree offers two unique and reciprocal opportunities: to imprint a willing recipient--the Tree itself--with your language, and to absorb and respond to the language of those who have come before you. The Giving Tree allows participants to change the language that nature speaks--and, in turn, rethink the kinds of dialogues we thereby make possible and in which we participate. The Tree's calm receptivity to fluxes in its environment encourages introspective awareness of our role in the personal and natural community of which we form parts.",

As participants pass through a veil of frog voices they are detected within the interior field of hundreds of pulse-luminous shoes. Frogs quiet at the approach, individual shoes light, and as the viewer passes, they play sounds from the realms of the world: marine, terra and the interior world: water, animal noises, bird calls, breath and heart beats. An overlapping aural map of the world pulses into life and dissipates with the passage of each visitor. This installation is a healing intention for the Burning Man community and for the Green world.",

The Veg Car will demonstrate to participants that the technology to allow diesel motors to run on veg is easy to understand and can be readily differentiated from the stock motor when looking at a converted car.  We hope to empower participants to take interest in reducing their vehicular carbon emissions, and demonstrate that running a diesel vehicle on veg is a viable alternative to fossil fuels.",

A creature of indeterminate origin out of sync with time and place greets participants; a hybrid expressing a point where evolutionary paths cross. Its body represents a timeline of evolution, from the beginning spark of life to a vision of future possibilities seen within its illuminated head. With a length of thirty feet and reaching a height of fifteen feet, the Chimera's form strains to lift and pull itself forward by its forearms, its head is bowed low powerfully pushing forward with its expanding mind as its sides labor with breath. Its reptilian body slopes away from its illuminated head, morphing into crustacean as it curls back into a segmented tail. From a distance the Chimera's presence is enlivened with pulsing breath-like fire running down the crest of its spine and light seeping out from within its body. The Chimera is a steel-based structure; the extremities of its spine fin, forearms, fishy tail and mastodon-like tusks are exposed sculpted steel, while its thorax, tail, neck and lower head are covered in a flexible skin evocative of a leathery organic surface. Its conical eyes protrude from its face, its glowing cranium is sculpted in translucent resin and fiberglass, allowing internally projected light and shadow to play across it.",

No longer oppressed by the hot daytime sun, his anger quickly escalates, with steam shooting out of his ears. At the pinnacle of his tantrum, his hat breaks open, releasing a jet of multi-colored methanol fury 70' into the sky. Once the cycle of anger is vented, the gnome returns to his deceivingly docile form. Until next time\u2026",

Soma's two neurons bond through electrochemical pulses. One neuron appears partially buried in the playa, the other floats overhead while an elegant axon arches between them. Fire and lighting effects flow like electrochemical signals from the buried, transmitting neuron over the high-reaching axon to the elevated, receiving neuron. Each cell body contains a spinning fiery nucleus. Long dendrites undulate away from them. Throughout the sculpture, fire and LED lighting accentuate not only the curves and geometric forms, but also the transmission of information. Soma offers participants an interactive installation that investigates the very basis of thought. It invites them to be an active force in this communication, to gather together and input via controls, sharing their knowledge and messages of warmth.",

This installation is a 10' diameter version of that watch, embedded in the desert surface. As biologists look inside animals to trace evolutionary ancestries, answers lie within The Watch. The interior clockwork is exposed, with additional gears scattered nearby. Built as a zoetrope, each spinning cog tells a story about how life came to be. Some cogs run the ticking clockwork, displaying stories that interlock to form our best understanding of the evolutionary clock's mechanisms. Other cogs are scattered nearby, re-telling origin theories discarded in favor of those that better fit with the scientific observations and discoveries of the past two centuries. ",

Viewed from the side, one encounters the rise of this curve as an eighteen foot long, seven foot tall undulating mirrored wall. Moving along the length of this wall, the viewer's reflection fractalizes and ripples in 30,000 small cut mirrors creating a kaleidoscopic self-portrait. Though apparently haphazard, this shifting self-reference is, in fact, driven by the directional selection of the viewers movement and constrained always within the homeostasis of the sine curve. Assuming the premise that all one ever encounters is the projection of mind, the viewer might question the shape of reality, and the nature of \"I\" in his or her own evolving consciousness.",
